## what is Object 
An object is an abstract data type that has properites and methods and could be inherted. 

## what is Class 
Class is like a blueprint that the objects are created from . 


# Interfaces and inhertance

## what is Interface ?
An interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement.
when we can say that this class implements the interface ?
when the class implements the required methods. 
basically be can say : 
that the interface is a list of methods that define some set of behavior for an object.
## her we can difrenciate between class and interface

**how we can declare an interface in Java ?**

## we define an interface with the interface keyword and list its methods with no bodies, just prototypes.
ex :

## We must notice that the methods in the interface must be defined as Public 
the reason that the interface describes the behaviour of an object , otherwise the user will see only the description but not the implementation. 

**when we want to implemet a class we put 
class ClassName  *implements* InterfaceName**

# Inheritance
what is inheritance ? 
it's simply defined as the creation of hierarchical classifications, which means that we can define a class with general properties then the class can then be inherited by other, more specific classes, each adding those things that are unique to it.
in Java we can say the class that would be inherted is called *SuperClass*, whereas the class that does inherting is called *Subclass*.
