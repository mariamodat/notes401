# Trees
## Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees
whats are trees ? 
it's a non-linear data structure compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes.
so it's a collection of data (Nodes) starting from the root and each node has a list of reference nodes. 
* **Root : the begining of the tree**
* **K : the max num of children that each node can have.** and for the binary k=2. 
* **left : referce to one node.**

## how to traverse through a tree ?
we have two ways 
* Depth First.
* Breadth First.

**what is Depth first concept ?**
the traversal starts at the root node,so we selecet an arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

**What is Breadth First ?**
We traverse through one entire level of children nodes first, before moving on to traverse through the grandchildren nodes.
