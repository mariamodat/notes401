# Understand Tasks and Back Stack
**What is a Stack?**
stack is a collection of activities , so each task is a collection of activities, however these will be arranged in the back stack, after finishing the task it will be popped from the stack.

## Managing Tasks 
this is done by doing all activites started in succession in the same task , 
following the STACK concept FILO.
first things first we should call setContentView() to define the layout for the activity's user interface.

* When onCreate() finishes, the next callback is always onStart().

* onStart() its the same of onCreate() the activity becomes visible to the user.
 
 * onResume() this would be invoked by the system before the activity starts interacting with the user.

**The onPause() callback always follows onResume()**
* onPuase() this may be called if the user pressed back button. so we can say when the activity loses focus.

* onStop()  when the activity is no longer visible to the user

* onRestart() it be invoked when the activity is stipped and state is about to restart.

* onDestroy() it's implemented to ensure that all of an activityâ€™s resources are released when the activity, or the process containing it, is destroyed.

and this would explain as well
