# Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application
it's a bi-directional that persistent connection between a web browser and a server.

so let's get started with gradle : 
* at first we have to Enable WebSocket in Spring by adding the configration and puttiong the annotation  @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker to the webSocket class . 
* then create the message model , as a JSON format  , 
**NOTE//** By default, Spring will use the Jackson library to convert our model object to and from JSON.
* create a controller to handle the message model , 
in this controller we will create a response message (OutputMessage) , then @SendTo annotation
* create a browser client by creating an HTML page , so we have to import the sockjs and stomp Javascript client libraries then create a connection function to start the connection btween our endpoint.

and this picture can explain the process briefly :
