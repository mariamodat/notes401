# Spring Boot and OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows the application Web Security to access the resources from the client , so every single file in the app will be protected unless we permit it or authorized the users to access. 

this explains the process :

so basically , we can say it's used to provide access to protected resources over the HTTP protocol.

so the process happens :
* client asks for an authorization.
*  Application requests an Access Token by authenticating with the Authorization Server.
* if it successfuly authorized ,the Authorization Server issues an Access Token and sends it to the Application.

* the app asks for access by showing the token.

## what annotations we will use ?
* AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter class which implements AuthorizationServerConfigurer interface and use @EnableAuthorizationServer annotation.

* @EnableResourceServer annotation and extend ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter class.
* @EnableResourceServer
