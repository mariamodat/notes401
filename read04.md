# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
## what is Object 
An object is an abstract data type that has properites and methods and could be inherted. 

## what is Class 
Class is like a blueprint that the objects are created from . 

## what is inhertance 
inhertance is is like making a copy of the original class or a prototype 
so it retains similar implementation. 
we can call the inherted class is a sub class from the super class . 

## what is interface 
* It is a collection of abstract methods class 
* A class implements an interface.
* an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types. 


## what is package 
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner

EX
 classes and inherting it :

# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
Bases :0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
if we can notice that number 11 or ten , are not one symbol , but it's two symbols together.
In binary you count "0,1,..." but then you run out of symbols!

# Hexadecimal Numbers
They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.



Decimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15
Hexadecimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F
