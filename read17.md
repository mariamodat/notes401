# Hibernate Many to Many Annotation 
this annotation is helpful to create a relation between two entities, so they will be linked together in the data base In a bi-directional association , we must notice that only one entity can be the owner of the relationship.

to make that so , at first we create two classes and we put the annotations to create the relation .. 
this explains what happens in the data base once we add the relation :

* **@JoinTable : is used to define the join/link table.**
* **@JoinColumn annotation used to specify the join/linking column with the main table.**
