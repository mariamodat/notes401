## Packages and Import

To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name.

A package is simply a container that groups related types (Java classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations). 
import java.awt.*;	Common GUI elements.
import java.awt.event.*;	The most common GUI event listeners.
import javax.swing.*;	More common GUI elements. Note "javax".
import java.util.*;	Data structures (Collections), time, Scanner, etc classes.
import java.io.*;	Input-output classes.
import java.text.*;	Some formatting classes.
import java.util.regex.*;	Regular expression classes.

##  Looping Statements
* for loop: A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.


* while loop: It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.


* do-while loop: the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
