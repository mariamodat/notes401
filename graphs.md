# Graphs 
what are graphs ?
they are a non-linear data collection stored in nodes and connected to each other by segments called edges.

## Terminology 
* **Vertex**: also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* **Edge**: is a connection between two nodes.
* **Neighbor**: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes
* **Degree**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Type of graphs 
Directed and undirected graphs 
 
 **Undirected Graphs** 
 or a bi-directional do not move in any directional 

 **Directed Graphs**
 graphs that has a direction , each node is directed to another.

 ## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.


### Comlete graphs 
graphs that all it's nodes have at least one edge.
### Connected and Disconnected 
difference between connected and disconnected graphs
